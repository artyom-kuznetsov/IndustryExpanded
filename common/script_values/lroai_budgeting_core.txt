# Government buildings do not typically produce goods, so it is not possible to judge their productivity. Instead, it is
# necessary to establish a special measure of their importance and the quantity needed by a country.

# At the moment, bureaucracy/ports/university are set to use 20%/10%/10% of the revenue
# I'll rework this at some point

# This leaves us with the military and construction sectors.
# Every country will try to employ its citizens as quickly as possible, until it can provide a job
# for almost every unemployed by the end of the year, including the yearly pop growth.
# Then it'll slowly switch its spending to military


# Here's a quick summary :

# (1) lroai_revenue_left_for_construction_military
# This is the country balance without the military and construction sectors expenses.
# It uses a factor to artificially increase/decrease the spending if we're above/under 50% of the gold reserve limit.
# 50% being the sweet spot we want to be at.

# (2) lroai_construction_expense_from_budget_maximum
# THis is 75% of (1). The construction sectors will try to never spend more than that.

# (3) lroai_construction_expense_maximum_from_pop
# This is the amount of money required by the government to reach/keep full employment next year.
# It takes account of the investment pool, meaning it can be 0.

# There's 2 main issues with lroai money spending
# 1) We use a lot of approximation that can accumulate.
# 2) Income and expense are very unstable for many reasons. We can't control that.

# But we still want :
# (1) To have enough reserve to be able to go to war without going bankrupt
# (2) To be under the gold reserve limit

# This is why we aim for 50% of the gold reserve limit.
# If a country is above that threshold, it means that, in average, lroai under-estimate the reality.
# If a country is above that threshold, it means that, in average, lroai over-estimate  the reality.
# This factor will help counter that and make sure we spend every penny the country earns, without going to debt.

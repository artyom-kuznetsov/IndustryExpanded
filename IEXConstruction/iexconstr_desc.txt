[h1]UrbanismPlus Module[/h1]
[h2]Contents of this module:[/h2]
- Rework of urban center PMs.
- With more urban centers you have in a state, construction there will slowly lose efficiency, naturally encouraging country-wide development and discouraging super-states.
- Rework of Construction Sector, making its PMs more modular and allowing slow upgrade.
- Reduced urbanization from government buildings, since they employ only 1K, but gave as much urbanization as a 5K industry.
- Reduced urbanization from fake buildings like financial districts, manor houses and company headquarters.

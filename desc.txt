[h1]Issues[/h1]
There is an issue of copper mines appearing in every state building list, even if it is not buildable. 
It happens because of "map-compatibility" measures and I have not found a way to avoid it (it could be worse - copper mines would be in the "agriculture" section).

[b]Korean Localization[/b] - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3163093442]Industry Expanded Korean Translate[/url] (Community-made)
Mod is made for game version [b]v1.6.2[/b]

[h2]Map-Compatible![/h2]
Industry Expanded is now compatible with mods that change map data:
This means, that IEX can be ran together with most alt-history mods that change borders or even resources.
All you have to do for compatibility is to place IEX [b]ABOVE[/b] the map mod.

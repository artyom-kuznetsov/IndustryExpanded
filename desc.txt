[h1]Issues[/h1]
There is an issue of copper mines appearing in every state building list, even if it is not buildable. 
It happens because of "map-compatibility" measures and I have not found a way to avoid it (it could be worse - copper mines would be in the "agriculture" section).

[h2]Map-Compatible![/h2]
Industry Expanded is now compatible with mods that change map data:
This means, that IEX can be ran together with any alt-history mod that changes borders or even resources.
All you have to do for compatibility is to place IEX [b]ABOVE[/b] the map mod.

A mod focused on goods, building, production methods and variability expansion, improvement and balancing.

Industry Expanded is a big mod, touching many aspects of the game.
IEX allows you to build your industry more flexibly: lack of a certain resource is not as harsh anymore, thanks to features like Ore Filtering and overall PM variability, for example:
Artillery production needs copper, but if you don't have it, you can use just iron/steel, resulting in less efficient production, but it's viable! You can use (previously useless in early game) oil for streetlights and paper production, instead of using sulfur.
Many buildings that needed to be, were seperated (for example, grocery and liquor, engines and automobiles).
This mod features a vast expansion in buildings and technologies, such as:
[b]- Machine Parts[/b], needed for automation and manufacturing of many goods.
[b]- Copper[/b] (no comments needed how valuable this is).
[b]- Oil Industry[/b], as well as [b]Synthetic Rubber[/b] and [b]Plastics[/b] production.
[b]- Synthetic Industry[/b]
[b]- Road Networks[/b], allowing you to increase infrastructure capacity before inventing railroads.
Industry Expanded changes many laws and institutions to be more logical or better gameplay-wise. Various institutions give you authority, while certain laws consume it. Isolationism is not just a debuff now.
Capitalists, employed in military-industrial buildings now tend to support Armed Forces, to represent military-industrial interests.
Qualifications and migration logic were also adjusted;

[i]Auto-Expand is now good too![/i]

[h1]Issues[/h1]
There is an issue of copper mines appearing in every state building list, even if it is not buildable. 
It happens because of "map-compatibility" measures and I have not found a way to avoid it (it could be worse - copper mines would be in the "agriculture" section).

[h2]Map-Compatible![/h2]
Industry Expanded is now compatible with mods that change map data:
This means, that IEX can be ran together with most alt-history mods that change borders or even resources.
All you have to do for compatibility is to place IEX [b]ABOVE[/b] the map mod.

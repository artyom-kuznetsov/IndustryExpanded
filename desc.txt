#### Old Description. It will be moved to the top as these features actually re-appear in the mod :P ####
[i]
Industry Expanded is a big mod, touching many aspects of the game.
IEX allows you to build your industry more flexibly and lack of a certain resource is not as harsh anymore, thanks to overall PM variety.
Many buildings that needed to be, were seperated (for example, grocery and liquor) or rebalanced to be more adjustable.
This mod and its modules feature a vast expansion in buildings and technologies, such as:
[b]- Oil Industry[/b], as well as [b]Synthetic Rubber[/b] and [b]Plastics[/b] production.
[b]- Synthetic Industry[/b]
[b]- Road Networks[/b], allowing you to increase infrastructure capacity before inventing railroads.
[b]- Difficult Terrain[/b], you can negate construction efficiency debuffs in mountainous/forested states by researching technologies.
[b]- Market Access Price Impact[/b] rework, now you need to improve infrastructure PMs to increase MAPI rather than just researching techs.
[b]- Auto-Expansion reworked to automatically expand buildings when you actually could use them.

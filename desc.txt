A mod focused on goods, building, production methods and variability expansion, improvement and balancing.

Industry Expanded is a big mod, touching many aspects of the game.
IEX allows you to build your industry more flexibly: lack of a certain resource is not as harsh anymore, thanks to features like Ore Filtering and overall PM variability, for example:
Artillery production needs copper, but if you don't have it, you can use just iron/steel, resulting in less efficient production, but it's viable! You can use (previously useless in early game) oil for streetlights and paper production, instead of using sulfur.
Many buildings that needed to be, were seperated (for example, grocery and liquor, engines and automobiles).
This mod features a vast expansion in buildings and technologies, such as:
[b]- Oil Industry[/b], as well as [b]Synthetic Rubber[/b] and [b]Plastics[/b] production.
[b]- Synthetic Industry[/b]
[b]- Road Networks[/b], allowing you to increase infrastructure capacity before inventing railroads.
Industry Expanded changes many laws and institutions to be more logical or better gameplay-wise. Various institutions give you authority, while certain laws consume it. Isolationism is not just a debuff now.
Capitalists, employed in military-industrial buildings now tend to support Armed Forces, to represent military-industrial interests.
Qualifications and migration logic were also adjusted;

[i]Auto-Expand is now good too![/i]

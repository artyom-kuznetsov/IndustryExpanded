[h1]Useful Whaling[/h1]
Didn't you feel that whaling in early game is absolutely useless? I did too, because oil had no use. Why did they give us an early oil source if didn't give an early oil use? With these new PMs for Paper Mills, Urban Centers and Synthetic Plants, you can effeciently utilize whaling.

[h1]Ore Filtering[/h1]
AI doesn't have enough resources to trade with you, while you are playing a country with no specific minerals? Now you can redirect some ore mining output for a bit of another resource.
